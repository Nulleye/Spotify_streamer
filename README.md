# Spotify streamer 

**Udacity Android nDegree - Project 1 & 2**  
This project is part of the Udacity Android online Nano-Degree co-created by Google.

It consists of a **Spotify client** that searches for artists by name and lists the selected artist's **top ten tracks**.
It also allows to play a **30 seconds preview** of each track using a nice player view. 
The player also has a sticky notification that can be used to explore and play the artist tracks while using another application.

It has been built from scratch and requires the course **Developing Andorid Apps: Fundamentals**.

## Improvements

An immediate improvement to this project is to support Spotify account settings to allow complete song play and not only 30 seconds preview.

Further improvements are those that make the application a complete Spotify player like:

* Song search, filtered or not by the selected artist.
* Favorite artists and songs management.
* User defined playlists.
